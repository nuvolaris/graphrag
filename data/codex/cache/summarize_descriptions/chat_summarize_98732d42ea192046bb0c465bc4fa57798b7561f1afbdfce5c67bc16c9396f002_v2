This canon outlines the scope of disciplinary measures that an Ordinary can exercise in various circumstances, including cases where a defendant is acquitted or not penalized. Specifically, Canon 1348 details the types of remedies and corrective actions available to church authorities, such as pastoral admonitions, which serve as spiritual guidance and correction rather than formal sanctions. The canon emphasizes that when a defendant is acquitted or not subjected to penalties, the Ordinary still retains the capacity to issue pastoral admonitions and employ other remedial measures aimed at spiritual correction and reconciliation. Overall, Canon 1348 delineates the authority and procedures available to church leaders to maintain discipline within the Church, ensuring that appropriate spiritual remedies can be applied even in cases where formal penalties are not imposed.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1759494707, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_7c233bf9d1", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 181, "prompt_tokens": 226, "total_tokens": 407, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
