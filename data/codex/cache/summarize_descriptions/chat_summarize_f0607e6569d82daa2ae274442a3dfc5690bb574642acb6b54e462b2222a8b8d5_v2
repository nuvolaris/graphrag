It also encompasses a specific form of censorship that involves prohibiting the celebration of sacraments, sacramentals, or acts of government authority. This form of censorship is designed to restrict certain religious or official acts as a disciplinary measure or moral correction. However, there are provisions within this form of censorship that allow for suspension in cases where there is an imminent danger to life, recognizing the necessity of prioritizing human safety and well-being. Overall, CENSURA functions both as a disciplinary tool within religious authority and as a means of controlling religious and official activities, with mechanisms in place to address urgent situations requiring immediate suspension.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1759494707, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_7c233bf9d1", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 162, "prompt_tokens": 202, "total_tokens": 364, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
