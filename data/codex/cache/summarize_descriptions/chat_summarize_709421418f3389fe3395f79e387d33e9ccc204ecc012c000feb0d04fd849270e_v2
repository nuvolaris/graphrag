It provides a structured framework for the regulation of ecclesiastical discipline, ensuring the proper functioning and moral integrity of the Church. Central to Canon Law are the rules and procedures that define various delicts—offenses or violations of Church laws—and prescribe appropriate sanctions and penalties for those found guilty of such infractions. These sanctions can range from admonitions and penances to more severe measures such as suspension, excommunication, or removal from clerical office. Canon Law serves to maintain doctrinal unity, moral discipline, and organizational order within the Church, addressing issues related to both individual conduct and institutional governance. It applies uniformly to clergy, religious members, and laity involved in Church activities, establishing clear guidelines for discipline and correction. Overall, Canon Law functions as the legal backbone of the Catholic Church, ensuring adherence to its doctrines and moral standards through a well-defined system of laws, sanctions, and disciplinary procedures.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1759494707, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_7c233bf9d1", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 206, "prompt_tokens": 228, "total_tokens": 434, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
