These laws are collectively known as canon law, which provides the legal framework for the governance of the Church and its members. Specifically, canon law addresses issues related to misconduct and penalties for clergy and religious, establishing procedures and sanctions to maintain discipline and uphold church teachings.\n\nThe term \"\"canon\"\" also denotes individual legal rules or statutes within the broader canon law system. For example, Canons 200 through 203 are specific provisions that govern the computation of time within canon law, outlining how certain periods are to be calculated for legal processes, deadlines, and procedural matters. These particular canons ensure clarity and consistency in legal procedures, facilitating the proper administration of justice within the Church.\n\nOverall, canon law functions as a comprehensive legal system that regulates the internal affairs of the Catholic Church, including the conduct of its clergy and religious members, the administration of sacraments, and the resolution of disputes. It is designed to uphold the spiritual and moral integrity of the Church community, ensuring that its members adhere to established doctrines and disciplinary standards. The laws are codified in a systematic manner, with specific canons like Can. 200 – 203 providing detailed guidance on procedural issues such as the computation of time, which is essential for the proper functioning of canonical processes.\n\nIn summary, \"\"canon\"\" in the context of the Catholic Church refers both to the individual legal rules that comprise canon law and to the entire legal system itself. It plays a crucial role in maintaining order, discipline, and doctrinal integrity within the Church, addressing misconduct, prescribing penalties, and regulating procedural matters through specific canons such as those governing the computation of time.\",6\n164,CAN. 1336,A specific canon within the canon law that details the types of penitential punishments and sanctions applicable to delinquents,1\n165,CAN. 1337,A canon that discusses the application of prohibitions and the necessary consent of ecclesiastical authority for certain sanctions,1\n166,CAN. 1338,\"A canon that specifies restrictions on applying penalties, emphasizing that penalties cannot be applied to certain ecclesiastical authorities or privileges\",1\n200,ORDINARIO,\"A Church authority, such as a bishop or local church leader, authorized to remit penalties and judge canonical cases\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n28,CANON,CAN. 1336,Canon 1336 details the types of penitential sanctions applicable to delinquents,7\n29,CANON,CAN. 1337,Canon 1337 discusses the application of prohibitions with the necessary ecclesiastical consent,7\n30,CANON,CAN. 1338,Canon 1338 specifies restrictions on applying penalties to certain church authorities,7\n50,CANON,ORDINARIO,\"An Ordinario can remit penalties within their jurisdiction, after consultation with the authority that imposed the penalty\",7\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
