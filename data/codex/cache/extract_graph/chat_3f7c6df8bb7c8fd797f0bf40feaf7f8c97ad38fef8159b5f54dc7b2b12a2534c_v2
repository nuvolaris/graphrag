La Chiesa ha il diritto nativo e proprio di costringere con sanzioni penali i fedeli che hanno commesso delitti.\n\n§ 2. Chi presiede nella Chiesa, deve custodire e promuovere il bene della stessa comunità e dei singoli fedeli, con la carità pastorale, con l’esempio della vita, con il consiglio e l’esortazione e, se necessario, anche con l’inflizione o la dichiarazione delle pene, secondo i precetti della legge, che sempre devono essere applicati con equità canonica, e tenendo presente la reintegrazione della giustizia, la correzione del reo e la riparazione dello scandalo.\n\n**Can. 1312 -** § 1. Le sanzioni penali nella Chiesa sono:  \n1º le pene medicinali o censure, elencate nei [cann. 1331-1333](cic_libroVI_1331-1335_it.html);  \n2º le pene espiatorie di cui nel [can. 1336.](cic_libroVI_1336-1338_it.html#Can._1336_-_§1)\n\n§ 2. La legge può stabilire altre pene espiatorie, che privino il fedele di qualche bene spirituale o temporale e siano congruenti con il fine soprannaturale della Chiesa.\n\n§ 3. Sono inoltre impiegati rimedi penali e penitenze, di cui nei cann. 1339 e 1340, quelli soprattutto per prevenire i delitti, queste piuttosto per sostituire la pena o in aggiunta ad essa.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_3f7c6df8bb7c8fd797f0bf40feaf7f8c97ad38fef8159b5f54dc7b2b12a2534c_v2"}
