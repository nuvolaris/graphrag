Despite facing harsh working conditions and receiving meager wages from Scrooge, Cratchit maintains a positive outlook on life, embodying the spirit of Christmas and familial love throughout the story. In a significant turn of events, reflecting Scrooge's transformation from a miser to a benefactor, he plans to send Cratchit a large turkey as a gift. This act of kindness symbolizes Scrooge's newfound generosity and directly impacts Cratchit and his family, offering them a glimpse of hope and joy.
